INFO: [ProjectBase 1-489] The host OS only allows 260 characters in a normal path. The project is stored in a path with more than 80 characters. If you experience issues with IP, Block Designs, or files not being found, please consider moving the project to a location with a shorter path. Alternately consider using the OS subst command to map part of the path to a drive letter.
Current project path is 'D:/Xillinx_Project/Comp/hlstrack2025-master/solver/L1/tests/cholesky/complex_fixed_arch0/cholesky_test.prj/sol1/.autopilot/db/ip_tmp'

WARNING: [IP_Flow 19-4832] The IP name 'kernel_cholesky_0_dsqrt_64ns_64ns_64_57_no_dsp_1_ip' you have specified is long. The Windows operating system has path length limitations. It is recommended you use shorter names to reduce the likelihood of issues.
ERROR: [Common 17-680] Path length exceeds 260-Byte maximum allowed by Windows: d:/Xillinx_Project/Comp/hlstrack2025-master/solver/L1/tests/cholesky/complex_fixed_arch0/cholesky_test.prj/sol1/.autopilot/db/ip_tmp/prj.srcs/sources_1/ip/kernel_cholesky_0_dsqrt_64ns_64ns_64_57_no_dsp_1_ip/kernel_cholesky_0_dsqrt_64ns_64ns_64_57_no_dsp_1_ip.xci
Please consider using the OS subst command to shorten the path length by mapping part of the path to a virtual drive letter. See Answer Record AR52787 for more information.
Resolution: In Windows 7 or later, the mklink command can also be used to create a symbolic link and shorten the path.
